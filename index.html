              <p>The experience you receive from Elsa's personal journey is like no other. She has been in an executive position for decades -- with that comes insights from lessons learned, various management strategies, and expertise in hiring, training and retention. An admirable characteristic of Elsa is her openness to new ideas. She is an outstanding listener who truly makes you feel heard and valued. While extensive experience can sometimes lead to the same way of management and a rigid approach, Elsa remains at the top of the latest practices and stays open minded to new perspectives. She is so resourceful. In any coaching situation, you want someone that you can relate to, you can connect with and you feel they have your best interest in mind. Elsa checks all the boxes and more. I am thankful for her guidance and thought-partnership over the years.</p>

              <p>I met Elsa in my very first job when I was a HR rotationer. I was young and puzzled starting my career, and Elsa came in as a great mentor to guide me through all stages of my career development, e.g., getting to know myself, creating the right opportunities, making hard decisions and completing transitions each time I decided to make a change. After 15 years, I have worked in 3 continents, 7 countries, energized to contribute every day with I do. I would not have been able to do any of this without Elsa’s support. Elsa is wise, reliable and one of the most altruistic leader I have ever met, you can trust her fully. I am very lucky to have met Elsa, till this day, she has become not just my mentor but a dear family and friend</p>

              <p>I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside Elsa at Dell, and more recently as my Executive Coach. Elsa is a remarkable professional and coach who has greatly impacted my career. More than a decade ago, Elsa helped me discover my passion for being a strategic HR Business Partner by teaching me the importance of learning everything you can about the business you are supporting. Specifically, Elsa sat alongside the sales teams for several days to discover the complexities of their jobs. Based on this approach, she architected a simple and effective HR strategy for the business. After seeing the results of her approach, I’ve leveraged this practice with my clients. It has been a game changer in curating organization development solutions that drive business impact.
              <br>
              In addition to her thoughtful approach to partnering with the business, Elsa has a unique, calming, and compassionate style that immediately puts others at ease. She creates a culture and environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and empowered to share new ideas. Elsa leaves every work environment she touches better than she found it. Her passion for creating supportive and high-performing workplaces makes her an invaluable asset to any organization. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have Elsa as my coach, and I know that anyone who works with her will be better for it.</p>
